0.8.2dev (unreleased)
---------------------

- Major refactor to rename most modules and incorporate the PYPIT ->
  PypeIt switch
- Add SlitMask, OpticalModel, and DetectorMap classes.  Implemented
  DEIMOSOpticalModel based on DEEP2 IDL code.
- Improved treatment of large offsets in
  pypeit.core.trace_slits.trace_gweight to be symmetric with
  trace_fweight. Large outlying pixels were breaking object tracing.
- Added thresholding in pypeit.core.tracewave to ensure that tilts are
  never crazy values due to extrapolation of fits which can break sky
  subtraction. 
- Turn off 2.7 Travis testing
- Integrated arclines into PypeIt
- Added KDTree algorithm to the wavelength calibration routines
- Modified debug/developer modes
- Update SpecObjs class; ndarray instead of list;  set() method
- Completely revamped object finding, global sky subtraction and local
  sky subtraction with new algorithms.
- Added -s option to run_pypeit for interactive outputs.
- Improved pypeit_show_spec2d script. 
- Fixed bug whereby -m --use_master was not being used by run_pypeit
  script.
- Overhaul of general algorithm for wavelength calibration
- Hot fix for bspline + requirements update
- Fixed issue with biases being written to disk as untrimmed. 
- Completely reworked flat fielding algorithm. 
- Fixed some parsing issues with the .pypeit file for cases where there
  is a whitepsace in the path.
- Implemented interactive plots with the -s option which allow the
  reduction to continue running.
- Modified global sky subtraction significantly to now do a polynomial
  fit. This greatly improves results for large slits.
- Updated loading of spectra and pypeit_show_1dspec script to work with
  new output data model.
- Implemeneted a new peak finding algorithm for arc lines which
  significantly improved wavelength fits.
- Added filtering of saturated arc lines which fixed issues with
  wavelength fits. 
- Added algorithms and data files for telluric correction of near-IR
  spectra.
- Revamped flat field roiutine to tweak slit boundaries based on slit
  illumination profile. Reworked calibrations class to accomodate the
  updated slit boundaries and tilts images as well as update the master
  files.
- Include BitMask class from MaNGA DAP.
- Change the way frame types are include in PypeItSetup.fitstbl
- Edited KeckLRISSpectrograph header keywords
- Edited how headers are read from the provided files
- Created metadata.PypeItMetaData class to handle what was previously
  `fitstbl`
- Fussed with date/time driven by GMOS;  date is no longer required in
  `fitstbl`
- Initial work on GMOS;  this is still work-in-progress
- Pushed several arcparam items into the Wavelengths parset
- Series of hacks for when binning is missing from the fitstbl
- CuAr line lists for GMOS
- New option to reduce only 1 det at a time
- Data provided in pypeit file overwrites anything read from the fits
  file headers.
- Filled in fits table reading data for GNIRS
